## MEASURES & BAR LINES

Music is written on a music staff, which features five parallel horizontal lines. The first thing youâ€™ll see written on the staff is the clef; the drum/percussion clef looks like a vertical rectangle and is used with non-pitched percussion instruments. With non-pitched percussion instruments like a drum set, notes written on different spaces and lines indicate that drum, bass drum, or cymbal. The staff is separated into individual measures \(or bars\) of music with thin vertical lines called bar lines. The number of beats in each measure is determined by the time signature.
